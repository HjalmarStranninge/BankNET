For your program to work with the sounds we have, you need this soundfile. 
Download the file and save it to a new folder on your computer.
Change the path in the sounds class from my path to your path.
It´s the code that starts with string successSoundFilePath....
The path is where you have saved the file on your computer and will loke something like this: 
		"C:\\Users\\sjood\\Downloads\\BankNET sounds\\Sounds_swish.wav"
Enjoy the program with the sound effects working!
